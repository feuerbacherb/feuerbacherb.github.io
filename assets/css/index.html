               <p>
                  My name is Brent Feuerbacher and I live in Briggs, TX, 20 miles from all major cities in central Texas.  When I was 13 years old, I started programming back in Atari 800, modifying the basic games that came with it and experimenting with escape characters for word processing.  I've since graduated to working on Web Forms with mid-tier processing and database back-ends.  Quite a feat from 1983!
               </p>
               <p>
                  In 2005, my son was born, and my wife and I had some serious talks about childcare and home-parenting.  By the time my daughter arrived in 2007, I had committed to being a stay-at-home father.  We have since lived in Virginia and South Carolina before coming back to Texas.  I have since worked as a Night Stocker / Sorter for Amazon as well as a Sales Porter for Johnson Sewell in Marble Falls, and was with Johnson Sewell until I decided to take the UT Coding Bootcamp to try and put myself back out in the programming community.
